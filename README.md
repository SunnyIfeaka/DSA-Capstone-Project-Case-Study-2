# DSA-Capstone-Project-Case-Study-2-Kultra-Mega-Stores-Inventory.
DSA Capstone data analysis project report for Kultra Mega Stores
## Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Analysis (2009â€“2012)
### Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a capstone requirement for the **DSA Data Analysis Class**. Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a Nigerian-based office supplies and furniture retailer headquartered in Lagos. As a **Business Intelligence Analyst** supporting the Abuja division, I was tasked with analyzing order and return data between 2009 and 2012 to uncover actionable business insights.
### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The core business questions were grouped into two scenarios:
#### Case Scenario I
1. Which product category had the highest sales? 
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales? 
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario? 
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers 
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
#### Case Scenario II
6. Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase? 
7. Which small business customer had the highest sales? 
8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012? 
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one? 
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to? 
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer.
 
### Tools Used

- **SQL Server** â€“ for all data querying and analysis
- **Excel** â€“ for initial file review.
- **GitHub** â€“ for version control and reporting.

 ## Data Analysis
 
#### Case Scenario I

*1. Which product category had the highest sales?*
```
select Product_Category, sum(sales) as Total_Sales
from [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Product_Category
order by Total_Sales desc
``` 
**Technology** generated the highest total sales.
Although Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is positioned as a specialist in **Office Supplies** and **Furniture**, the analysis reveals that the **Technology category had the highest total sales** between 2009 and 2012.

**Interpretation & Business Implications:**

- **Hidden Revenue Stream**  
  Technology products are driving significant revenue and may be under-promoted. This presents an opportunity to expand offerings or upsell technology products.

- **Marketing Repositioning Opportunity**  
  KMS may need to slightly adjust its brand messaging to reflect its actual sales strengths. Messaging such as "Complete Office Solutions â€“ Furniture, Supplies & Tech" may resonate more with what customers are buying.

- **Inventory Strategy Adjustment**  
  Current procurement may be skewed toward office supplies and furniture. A shift toward stocking high-demand tech items could improve availability and boost profit margins.


*2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?*
 ```
select Region, sum(sales) as Total_Sales
from [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Region
order by Total_Sales desc
```
 
The analysis of total sales across Canadian regions revealed the following:

##### Top 3 Regions by Sales:
- **West**
- **Ontario**
- **Prairie**

These regions collectively contribute the highest revenue to KMS, indicating strong market presence and customer engagement.

#####  Bottom 3 Regions by Sales:
- **Yukon**
- **Northwest Territories**
- **Nunavut**

These territories generated the least revenue during the 2009â€“2012 period, showing limited penetration or purchasing activity.

#####  Interpretation & Business Implications:

- **Strongholds Identified**  
  The top regions should remain strategic focus areas for retention, upselling, and pilot programs for new products.

- **Market Development Opportunity**  
  The bottom 3 regions represent **underserved or untapped markets**. Limited logistics, awareness, or infrastructure may be restricting demand.


*3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?*
```
select sum(sales) as Total_Sales
from [KMS Sql Case Study]
where Product_Sub_Category = 'appliances' and Region = 'Ontario'
```

The analysis of product-category sales by province revealed that **â‚¦202,346.84** worth of **Appliances** were sold in **Ontario** between 2009 and 2012.

###  Interpretation & Business Implications:

- **Strong Category Performance in Key Region**  
  Ontario, being one of KMSâ€™s top revenue-generating regions, also shows significant interest in appliance products â€” a category not explicitly mentioned in KMS's specialization.

- **Cross-Selling Opportunity**  
  Since Ontario is a high-performing region and Appliances have strong sales there, KMS can explore bundling **Appliances with Furniture or Office Supplies** to boost overall revenue per transaction.


*4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers*
```
select Customer_Name, sum(sales) as Total_Sales
from [KMS Sql Case Study]
group by Customer_Name
order by Total_Sales desc
```

 An analysis of the bottom 10 customers by total sales revealed:
- Very **low order frequency**
- In some cases, **negative or minimal profit**
- A spread across various segments (Consumer, Small Business, etc.)
- Limited purchase of high-margin categories like Technology or Furniture

###  Interpretation & Business Implications:

- These customers are **currently inactive or disengaged**, but represent a potential revenue stream if reactivated properly.
- Low transaction volumes suggest that KMS may not be top-of-mind or competitively priced for their needs.
- Some may only buy low-ticket items or one-off purchases, leading to poor lifetime value.
