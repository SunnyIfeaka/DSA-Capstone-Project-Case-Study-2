### Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a capstone requirement for the **DSA Data Analysis Class**. Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a Nigerian-based office supplies and furniture retailer headquartered in Lagos. As a **Business Intelligence Analyst** supporting the Abuja division, I was tasked with analyzing order and return data between 2009 and 2012 to uncover actionable business insights.

5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
